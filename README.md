# Spectrality

An interactive GUI tool for analysing audio spectra based on [Constant-Q Sliding DFT](https://github.com/jurihock/qdft).

Features planned:

- Sliding sample-by-sample analysis with logarithmic frequency resolution
- Multitrack spectrogram visualisation with synchronous zoom and mouse cursor tracking
- Additional transformations such as cepstrogram or chromagram
- Maybe even interactive audio playback and spectral processing
